    <p>
        Singapore is actively preparing for the transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to ensure the continued security of its digital communications and records. The effort is being led by the Ministry of Communications and Information, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, and the Information and Media Development Authority, in collaboration with other relevant agencies.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Roles Singapore is Playing</h2>

    <h3>Monitoring NIST Standardization</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Singapore is closely monitoring the PQC standardization process led by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Developing Quantum-Safe Approaches</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The country is actively working on developing quantum-safe approaches for securing digital communications and records.</li>
        <li>This involves exploring both PQC and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) as potential solutions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Building a National Quantum-Safe Network</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Singapore has announced plans to build a National Quantum-Safe Network (NQSN), which will initially consist of 10 nodes and incorporate both PQC and QKD technologies.</li>
        <li>The network aims to provide a secure and resilient infrastructure for critical communications in the quantum era.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Collaborating with Industry Partners</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Singapore is working with companies like Frauenhofer Singapore and AWS to develop use cases for the NQSN.</li>
        <li>They have also partnered with SPTel and quantum firm SpeQtral to build the NQSN+ network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conducting Pilot Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A pilot project for QKD between two data centers in Singapore was successfully completed by the NQSN and STT GDC.</li>
        <li>This demonstrated the feasibility and potential of quantum-safe communication technologies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        While a specific timeline for Singapore's PQC transition is not publicly available, the country's proactive approach, focus on both PQC and QKD, and collaboration with industry partners demonstrate its commitment to ensuring a secure digital future in the face of quantum computing advancements.
