        <h1>Australia's Approach to Post-Quantum Cryptography</h1>
        <p>
            Australia, through the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), is actively involved in promoting the transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to mitigate the risks posed by cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs).
        </p>
    
        <h2>Key Aspects of Australia's Strategy</h2>
    
        <h3>Monitoring PQC Standardization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ASD actively monitors global PQC standardization efforts, especially those led by NIST in the USA. This involves evaluating parameters and staying updated on the latest developments in PQC algorithms.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Updating National Cryptographic Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ASD is committed to updating its Information Security Manual (ISM) to incorporate the latest PQC standards. This ensures that Australian organizations have access to approved and effective quantum-resistant algorithms.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Encouraging Research and Practical Trials</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ASD encourages research, testing, and practical trials of PQC algorithms. This proactive approach helps in understanding the real-world implications of PQC and facilitating its adoption across various sectors.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Prioritizing Data Protection and Transition Planning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Australia emphasizes the importance of identifying and inventorying applications and equipment that rely on public key cryptography. This helps organizations understand their vulnerabilities and prioritize data protection efforts.</li>
            <li>Organizations are encouraged to develop transition plans that include testing and adopting new PQC algorithms while decommissioning legacy systems.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Collaboration with International Partners</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Australia recognizes the global nature of the quantum threat and collaborates with international partners, including the United States' Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and NIST, to share information and best practices for PQC migration.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Reservations about QKD</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>While ASD acknowledges the potential of quantum key distribution (QKD) as an alternative approach to secure communications, it doesn't recommend its use at present due to practical limitations. The focus remains on promoting PQC adoption as a practical and cost-effective solution to address the quantum threat.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Fostering the Quantum Industry</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Australia's commitment to a post-quantum future extends beyond cybersecurity. The country is actively fostering the growth of the quantum industry through its National Quantum Strategy, promoting research and development in quantum technologies.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            Australia's comprehensive approach to post-quantum cryptography aims to ensure the nation's security and leadership in the emerging quantum landscape. By promoting awareness, updating guidelines, fostering collaboration, and investing in quantum research, Australia is well-prepared to address the challenges posed by quantum computing advancements.
