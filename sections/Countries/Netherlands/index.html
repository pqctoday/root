        <p>
            The Netherlands, through its National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), is actively involved in promoting the transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Their strategy emphasizes a collaborative, proactive, and multi-layered approach to address the quantum threat.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Key Aspects of the Netherlands' Role in the PQC Transition</h2>
    
        <h3>Raising Awareness and Providing Concrete Guidance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Netherlands is committed to educating organizations about the quantum threat and providing clear guidance for migration to PQC.</li>
            <li>The NCSC has published resources like "<strong>Maak je organisatie quantumveilig</strong>," which translates to "Make your organization quantum-safe," aimed at raising awareness and providing practical steps for organizations to prepare for the transition.</li>
            <li>They have also developed "<strong>Het crypto-agilitymonster op een bierviltje</strong>," or "The crypto-agility monster on a beer mat," to simplify the complex topic of cryptographic agility.</li>
            <li>In collaboration with TNO and CWI, the NCSC published "<strong>The PQC Migration Handbook: Guidelines for Migrating to Post-Quantum Cryptography</strong>," offering practical advice for organizations to create a tailored migration plan.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Advocating for Early Adoption and Cryptographic Agility</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Netherlands stresses the importance of early action to mitigate the quantum threat, particularly for organizations dealing with data that requires long-term confidentiality.</li>
            <li>They emphasize the need for organizations to be "cryptographically agile," allowing them to adapt to evolving cryptographic standards and technologies.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Recommending Hybrid Solutions and Specific Algorithms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The NCSC advises the use of hybrid cryptographic solutions that combine PQC algorithms with existing (quantum-vulnerable) algorithms to provide additional security during the transition phase.</li>
            <li>They specifically recommend AES-256 for symmetric cryptography, SPHINCS-256 for stateless digital signatures, and XMSS for stateful digital signatures.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Emphasizing Inventory and Risk Assessment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Netherlands encourages organizations to conduct a thorough inventory of their cryptographic assets and perform a quantum risk assessment to prioritize their migration efforts.</li>
            <li>This helps organizations understand their vulnerabilities and focus on the most critical systems first.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Collaborating with International Partners</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Netherlands is actively engaged in international collaborations to promote a coordinated approach to PQC transition.</li>
            <li>They are a co-chair, along with France and Germany, of the NIS Cooperation Group's PQC workstream, working towards a unified roadmap for PQC migration across the European Union.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Prioritizing PQC Over QKD</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Like Germany and France, The Netherlands prioritizes PQC over Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) as the primary solution for quantum-safe communications.</li>
            <li>They believe QKD is not yet mature enough for widespread adoption and should primarily be considered a complementary security measure.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            The Netherlands' comprehensive and collaborative approach, combined with their emphasis on early adoption, cryptographic agility, and practical guidance, demonstrates their commitment to ensuring the security of their digital infrastructure in the face of the quantum threat.
