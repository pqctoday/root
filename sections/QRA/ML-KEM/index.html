    <h2>Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs)</h2>

    <p>A Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) is a cryptographic method used to establish a shared secret key between two parties communicating over a public channel. KEMs are particularly useful for secure communication tasks such as encryption and authentication.</p>
    
    <h3>Components of a KEM</h3>
    <p>KEMs consist of three algorithms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Key Generation (KeyGen):</b> This algorithm generates a public encapsulation key and a private decapsulation key.</li>
      <li><b>Encapsulation (Encaps):</b> This algorithm uses the encapsulation key and randomness to create a shared secret key and a ciphertext.</li>
      <li><b>Decapsulation (Decaps):</b> This deterministic algorithm uses the decapsulation key and ciphertext to produce a shared secret key.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How KEMs Work</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Alice runs KeyGen to produce an encapsulation key and a decapsulation key. She keeps the decapsulation key private and sends the encapsulation key to Bob.</li>
      <li>Bob uses the encapsulation key and Encaps to generate a shared secret key and a ciphertext. He sends the ciphertext to Alice.</li>
      <li>Alice uses the ciphertext and her private decapsulation key with Decaps to derive the shared secret key. If no interference or corruption occurred, Alice and Bob now share the same secret key.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Types of KEMs</h3>
    <p>One example of a KEM is ML-KEM, also known as CRYSTALS-Kyber. This lattice-based KEM is standardized by NIST and considered secure even against adversaries with quantum computers. ML-KEM is not a direct replacement for Diffie-Hellman key exchange, but it can be used to establish a shared secret key that can then be used for symmetric-key cryptography. There is a subtle difference between the functionality of KEMs and Key Exchange (KE) algorithms, although this is beyond the scope of this response.</p>
    
    <h3>Benefits of KEMs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>KEMs offer easy key management, as public keys can be broadcast and used by anyone without needing a secure channel for exchange.</li>
      <li>They use asymmetric cryptography, which simplifies key management even though it can be slow.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Decapsulation failures occur when the shared secret keys generated by Alice and Bob do not match, despite well-formed inputs and successful randomness generation.</li>
      <li>The public-key encryption scheme K-PKE is a component of ML-KEM and should not be used as a standalone cryptographic scheme.</li>
      <li>The security of KEM implementations depends on factors such as resistance to side-channel attacks and active attacks like faults.</li>
      <li>Proper key management is crucial, as the compromise of a key can lead to the compromise of all protected information. Key management processes should cover key generation, registration, distribution, installation, usage, protection, storage, access, recovery, and destruction.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>KEMs are a valuable tool in modern cryptography for secure key establishment. Their robust design and standardization make them a reliable choice for protecting sensitive information in various applications.</p>
