    <h2>Pure PQC Certificates</h2>
    <p>Pure Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) certificates are designed to be secure against quantum computer attacks. They use algorithms that are believed to be resistant to the computational power of quantum computers, ensuring long-term security for digital communications.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Hybrid Certificates</h2>
    <p>Hybrid certificates combine traditional cryptographic algorithms with post-quantum algorithms. This approach provides a transitional solution, offering security against both classical and quantum attacks. Hybrid certificates ensure compatibility with existing systems while preparing for future quantum threats.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Composite Certificates</h2>
    <p>Composite certificates use multiple cryptographic algorithms simultaneously. They provide a higher level of security by requiring an attacker to break all included algorithms to compromise the certificate. This method enhances robustness against various types of cryptographic attacks.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Other Options</h2>
    <p>Other options for digital certificates include traditional certificates that use well-established cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and ECC. These certificates are widely used and trusted for securing digital communications, but they may not be secure against future quantum attacks.</p>
