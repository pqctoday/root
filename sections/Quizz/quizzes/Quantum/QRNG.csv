"What is the fundamental difference between QRNG and TRNG?", "QRNG relies on software algorithms, while TRNG uses physical processes.", "QRNG uses quantum mechanics to generate random numbers, while TRNG relies on classical physical phenomena.","QRNG is more suitable for high-speed applications, while TRNG is better for low-power devices.", "QRNG is a newer technology, while TRNG is an older technology.",2,dummy
"What is a key advantage of QRNG over TRNG?", "QRNG can generate truly random numbers, whereas TRNG often produces pseudo-random numbers.", "QRNG is more resistant to environmental noise and other external influences.", "Both A and B", "None of the above.",3,dummy
"What is a potential challenge associated with QRNG?", "The complexity and cost of developing and deploying QRNG systems can be higher than those for TRNG.", "The performance of QRNG systems can be affected by factors such as temperature and quantum noise.", "Both A and B", "None of the above.",3,dummy
"What is a key consideration when choosing between QRNG and TRNG?", "The level of security required for the specific application.", "The performance requirements of the system.", "Both A and B", "None of the above.",3,dummy
"What is a common approach in practical implementations of random number generators?", "Using a hybrid approach that combines QRNG and TRNG to leverage the strengths of both technologies.", "Relying solely on QRNG for all applications due to its superior randomness quality.", "Using only TRNG due to its maturity and lower cost.", "None of the above.",1,dummy
