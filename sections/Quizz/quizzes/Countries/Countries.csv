"What is the general consensus among leading countries regarding the quantum threat to cryptography?","The threat is considered insignificant and no immediate action is required.","The threat is real and urgent, requiring immediate action to prepare for the transition to post-quantum cryptography.","The threat is acknowledged but considered a long-term issue that does not require immediate attention.","There is no consensus among countries regarding the quantum threat.",2,dummy
"What is the primary focus of international efforts to address the quantum threat?","Developing quantum computers to counter the threat posed by adversaries.", "Investing in quantum key distribution (QKD) as the primary solution.", "Standardizing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms and promoting their adoption.", "Restricting research and development in quantum computing.",3,dummy
"What role does the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) play in the global PQC landscape?","NIST is leading the standardization effort for PQC algorithms, providing a framework for global interoperability and security.", "NIST is focusing solely on developing quantum computers for national security purposes.", "NIST is not involved in PQC standardization or research.", "NIST is primarily focused on developing quantum-resistant blockchain technology.",1,dummy
"What are some of the key challenges that countries face in migrating to PQC?","The lack of available PQC algorithms that meet the required security standards.","Resistance from industry stakeholders who are reluctant to adopt new cryptographic solutions.","Limited awareness and understanding of the quantum threat and the need for PQC migration.","All of the above.",3,dummy
"What is the recommended approach for organizations to begin preparing for the post-quantum era?", "Wait for clear regulatory mandates before taking any action.", "Focus solely on quantum key distribution (QKD) as the solution.", "Conduct a risk assessment to identify quantum vulnerabilities, develop a migration plan, and start experimenting with PQC algorithms.", "Ignore the threat as it is considered a distant future problem.",3,dummy
