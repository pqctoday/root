"What is the harvest today decrypt later attack?","It involves stealing encrypted data today with the plan to decrypt it later using a quantum computer.","It involves using a quantum computer to break into systems and steal data today.","It involves using a quantum computer to decrypt data that was encrypted using weak algorithms.",It involves using a quantum computer to launch denial-of-service attacks.,1,dummy 
"Why is the harvest today decrypt later attack a concern?",Because threat actors are already collecting encrypted data that could be decrypted in the future when powerful quantum computers become available.,Because quantum computers are already powerful enough to break some types of encryption.,"Because quantum computers can be used to launch other types of attacks such as denial-of-service attacks.","Because quantum computers can be used to steal data that is not encrypted.",1,dummy
"What types of data are most vulnerable to the harvest today decrypt later attack?","Data that is encrypted using public-key cryptography and has a long shelf life such as government secrets or intellectual property.",Data that is encrypted using symmetric-key cryptography.,Data that is not encrypted.,Data that is stored in the cloud.,1,dummy
"What can organizations do to protect themselves from the harvest today decrypt later attack?",Migrate to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms.,Use quantum key distribution (QKD).,Reduce the shelf life of sensitive data.,All of the above.,4,dummy
