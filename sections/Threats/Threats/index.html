        <h2>Harvest Now / Decrypt Later</h2>
        <p>This threat involves adversaries collecting encrypted data now with the intention of decrypting it later when quantum computers become powerful enough to break current encryption algorithms. This poses a significant risk to the confidentiality of sensitive information.</p>

        <h2>Software Supply Chain Attacks</h2>
        <p>Quantum computers could potentially be used to compromise the software supply chain by breaking cryptographic protections used in software distribution. This could allow attackers to inject malicious code into software updates or packages, affecting a wide range of users.</p>

        <h2>Legal Document Digital Signing Threats</h2>
        <p>Digital signatures used in legal documents rely on cryptographic algorithms that could be broken by quantum computers. This would undermine the integrity and authenticity of digitally signed legal documents, leading to potential legal disputes and fraud.</p>
