The threat of quantum computing to the software supply chain is multifaceted and poses significant risks to organizations that rely on software from third-party vendors. Here are some insights into the threats:

Compromised Software Updates: One major concern is the potential for threat actors to exploit quantum computing capabilities to deliver fake software updates. These malicious updates could be designed to install backdoors or malware, allowing attackers to gain control of critical systems. Since quantum computers could break traditional cryptographic signatures used to verify the authenticity of software updates, this attack vector becomes much more potent [1, 2].
Exploitation of Vulnerable Cryptography: Software supply chains often involve multiple vendors and complex dependencies. If any component within this chain relies on quantum-vulnerable cryptography, it becomes a potential entry point for attackers. Quantum computers could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the integrity of software components or intercept sensitive data during transit [3].
Lack of Visibility and Control: Organizations often have limited visibility into the security practices of their software vendors, especially those further down the supply chain. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the quantum readiness of the entire software ecosystem and increases the risk of hidden vulnerabilities [3, 4].
Slow Adoption of PQC: The transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a complex undertaking that requires significant time and resources. If software vendors are slow to adopt PQC, their products will remain vulnerable to quantum attacks, putting their customers at risk. This necessitates clear communication and collaboration between organizations and their software vendors to ensure a timely and secure migration [3, 5].
