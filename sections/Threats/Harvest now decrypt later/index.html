    <h1>Harvest Now Decrypt Later</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" threat refers to the practice of intercepting and storing encrypted communications with the intention of decrypting them once the necessary computational power or cryptographic breakthroughs become available. This is particularly concerning in the context of advancements in quantum computing, which could potentially break widely used encryption algorithms.</p>

        <h2>Detailed Explanation</h2>
        <p>In the "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" scenario, attackers collect encrypted data today, anticipating that future technological advancements will allow them to decrypt this data. Quantum computers, which leverage the principles of quantum mechanics, have the potential to solve certain mathematical problems much faster than classical computers. This includes the ability to break current encryption methods such as RSA and ECC, which rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers or solving discrete logarithm problems.</p>
        <p>As a result, sensitive information that is encrypted and transmitted today could be at risk of exposure in the future. Organizations and individuals must be aware of this threat and consider adopting quantum-resistant encryption methods to protect their data against future decryption attempts.</p>
