    <h1>Harvest Now Decrypt Later</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" threat refers to the practice of intercepting and storing encrypted communications with the intention of decrypting them once the necessary computational power or cryptographic breakthroughs become available. This is particularly concerning in the context of advancements in quantum computing, which could potentially break widely used encryption algorithms.</p>
        <p>In the "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" scenario, attackers collect encrypted data today, anticipating that future technological advancements will allow them to decrypt this data. Quantum computers, which leverage the principles of quantum mechanics, have the potential to solve certain mathematical problems much faster than classical computers. This includes the ability to break current encryption methods such as RSA and ECC, which rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers or solving discrete logarithm problems.</p>
        <p>As a result, sensitive information that is encrypted and transmitted today could be at risk of exposure in the future. Organizations and individuals must be aware of this threat and consider adopting quantum-resistant encryption methods to protect their data against future decryption attempts.</p>

    <h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
    <p>The harvest now, decrypt later (HNDL) attack is a significant threat posed by the advancement of quantum computing. This type of attack involves adversaries collecting encrypted data today with the intention of decrypting it later when quantum computers become powerful enough to break current encryption algorithms.</p>
    <p>The following points elaborate on the HNDL threat:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> The primary motivation behind HNDL attacks is to gain access to sensitive information that has long-term value, such as government secrets, intellectual property, or financial data.</li>
        <li><strong>Targets:</strong> Organizations that handle sensitive data with a long shelf-life, like government agencies, critical infrastructure providers, and financial institutions, are particularly vulnerable.</li>
        <li><strong>Urgency:</strong> The threat from HNDL attacks is immediate because adversaries can start collecting data now, even though quantum computers are not yet capable of breaking current encryption. This makes early preparation for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) crucial.</li>
        <li><strong>Data with long-term value:</strong> Data that requires protection for an extended period, such as classified state secrets or personal data subject to privacy regulations, is at higher risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Successful HNDL attacks could result in the disclosure of sensitive information, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and national security threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Migrating to PQC is the primary defense against HNDL attacks. This involves identifying and prioritizing systems and data that require long-term protection and implementing quantum-resistant algorithms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall, the harvest now, decrypt later threat highlights the urgency for organizations to start preparing for the post-quantum era. By taking proactive steps to migrate to PQC and enhance their cybersecurity posture, organizations can mitigate the risks posed by this emerging threat.</p>
