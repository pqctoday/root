Here's a list of main milestones in the history of cryptography, highlighting key breakthroughs:

Ancient Times (circa 1900 BC) - Scytale and Caesar Cipher:
Breakthrough: Basic substitution ciphers like the Caesar cipher where letters are shifted in the alphabet.

Classical Era (circa 5th Century BC) - Greek and Roman Ciphers:
Breakthrough: Development of more complex substitution ciphers, including the Spartan scytale for transposition.

Middle Ages to Renaissance (9th to 15th Century) - Polyalphabetic Ciphers:
Breakthrough: Leon Battista Alberti invents the polyalphabetic cipher, introducing the concept of changing cipher alphabets during encryption.

16th Century - Vigenère Cipher:
Breakthrough: Blaise de Vigenère develops the Vigenère cipher, which uses a keyword to shift letters multiple times, making it much harder to crack than simple monoalphabetic ciphers.

World War I & II (20th Century) - Mechanical Encryption:
Breakthrough: Invention of the Enigma machine by Arthur Scherbius. Its complexity and rotor-based encryption system were significant until broken by cryptanalysts like Alan Turing.

Post-WWII (1940s-1970s) - Digital Era Begins:
Breakthrough: Development of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) by IBM, one of the first public cryptographic algorithms for securing digital data.

1970s - Public-Key Cryptography:
Breakthrough: Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman propose public-key cryptography, followed by the RSA algorithm by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. This was revolutionary as it allowed secure communication without prior secret sharing.

1990s - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):
Breakthrough: AES, developed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, becomes the standard for securing data, replacing DES due to its superior strength and efficiency.

21st Century - Quantum Cryptography:
Breakthrough: The practical implementation of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), first proposed by Stephen Wiesner and later demonstrated by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard. QKD uses the principles of quantum mechanics to ensure secure key distribution.

Current Developments - Post-Quantum Cryptography:
Breakthrough: With the advent of quantum computing, there's active research into post-quantum cryptography aiming to develop algorithms that are secure against both classical and quantum computing attacks.
